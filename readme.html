<h1>A guide to Cleaner Gallery</h1>

<p><em>Cleaner Gallery</em> was written to take care of the invalid <acronym title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</acronym> that WordPress produces when using the <code>[gallery]</code> shortcode.</p>

<p>It does a bit more than that though.  It will integrate with many Lightbox-type scripts and allow you to do much cooler things with your galleries.  Plus, it has a couple of extra options that you can play around with.</p>

<h2>How to install the plugin</h2>

<ol>
<li>Uzip the <code>cleaner-gallery.zip</code> folder.</li>
<li>Upload the <code>cleaner-gallery</code> folder to your <code>/wp-content/plugins</code> directory.</li>
<li>In your WordPress dashboard, head over to the <em>Plugins</em> section.</li>
<li>Activate <em>Cleaner Gallery</em>.</li>
</ol>

<h2>How to use the plugin</h2>

<p>Once you've activated the plugin, you don't have to do anything else for clean, valid <acronym title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</acronym> galleries.</p>

<p>However, there are a few options you can set.  Go to <em>Cleaner Gallery</em>, which is located under your <em>Appearance</em> menu in your WordPress dashboard.  From there, you'll see several settings to choose from.</p>

<p>Oh yeah, you might want to know how to actually <a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Using_the_gallery_shortcode" title="Using the [gallery] shortcode">use the gallery shortcode</a> as well.  I would say that's fairly important.</p>

<h2>Gallery Settings</h2>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Default gallery settings:</strong>  Allows you to set up how your galleries should be displayed by default.  Most of these settings can be overwritten with the use of custom options in the <code>[gallery]</code> shortcode.</li>
	<li><strong>Image caption settings:</strong>  Allows you to remove all captions, use the image title when no caption is present, and/or link the captions to the image attachment page.</li>
	<li><strong>Script and style settings:</strong>  Be sure to check the box to load the <em>Cleaner Gallery</em> stylesheet unless you're creating a custom stylesheet for your site.  You can also choose for the plugin to load the Thickbox stylesheet and JavaScript (included with WordPress).</li>
	<li><strong>External image script:</strong>  Select a supported Lightbox-type script that you've installed and configured on your site.</li>
</ul>


<p>The <em>Default Image Size</em>, <em>Default Order</em>, and <em>Default Orderby</em> allow you to select site-wide settings.  These can be overwritten on a post-by-post basis.</p>

<h2>Supported Lightbox-type scripts</h2>

<p>I imagine this is the reason many of you downloaded the plugin.  It will integrate nicely with many different Lightbox-type scripts.  Here is the officially supported list.  This plugin has been tested and works with any of these.</p>

<p>To use one of these, you only need to load the appropriate JavaScript and/or <acronym title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</acronym> and select one from the <em>Image Script</em> drop-down box (<em>see below if your script is not listed here</em>).</p>

<h2>Using an alternate script</h2>

<p>If you're using a Lightbox-type script that this plugin doesn't support yet, you should let me know.  I'll be happy to add the appropriate code.  Since it's usually a while between updates, you'll have to manually add support until the plugin can be updated.</p>

<p>Most Lightbox-style scripts require a custom <code>class</code> and/or <code>rel</code> attribute.  To make custom ones, you can add this to your theme's <code>functions.php</code>:</p>

<pre><code>add_filter( 'cleaner_gallery_image_link_class', 'my_gallery_image_link_class' );

function my_gallery_image_link_class( $class ) {
	return 'custom-class';
}

add_filter( 'cleaner_gallery_image_link_rel', 'my_gallery_image_link_rel' );

function my_gallery_image_link_rel( $rel ) {
	return 'custom-rel';
}</code></pre>

<h2>Customize your gallery style</h2>

<p>Customizing your galleries can be very simple.  Here's some <acronym title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</acronym> you can apply to your theme's <code>style.css</code> file.</p>

<pre><code>.gallery {
	/* Style rules for the entire gallery */
	}
.gallery-item {
	/* Style rules for each item (image and caption) in the gallery */
	}
.gallery-icon {
	/* Style rules for images within the gallery */
	}
.gallery-caption {
	/* Style rules for captions within the gallery */
	}</code></pre>

<p>You can also style individual galleries.  All you need to do is figure out the <acronym title="Identification">ID</acronym> of the particular post the gallery is for.  So, you could style the gallery for post <code>95</code> like so:</p>

<pre><code>#gallery-95 {
	/* Style rules specifically for the gallery associated with post ID of 95 */
	}</code></pre>

<h2>Load a completely custom stylesheet</h2>

<p>If you want even more control over your gallery style, you could get rid of the default stylesheet and load your own.  You have two options for disabling the stylesheet.  The first is to uncheck the box to include it on the <em>Cleaner Gallery</em> settings page.  This option is best for users.</p>

<p>The second option is best for theme developers.  So, what you'd do first is add this to your theme's <code>functions.php</code> file:</p>

<pre><code>add_action( 'wp_print_scripts', 'my_deregister_styles' );

function my_deregister_styles() {
	wp_deregister_style( 'cleaner-gallery' );
}</code></pre>

<p>This will disable the default gallery styling.  You could then create completely custom style rules.  A good place to start would be copying the contents of <code>gallery.css</code> into your theme's <code>style.css</code> and altering bits and pieces at a time.</p>

<h2>Creating a paginated gallery</h2>

<p>While the plugin has no way of paginating its own galleries, it's very much possible to make this happen using the WordPress <code>&lt;!--nextpage--></code> tag.</p>

<p>Let's suppose we have 12 images we want to show.  The first six will be on the first page while the following six will be on the second page.  You'd use this code in the post editor:</p>

<pre><code>[gallery numberposts="6"]

&lt;!--nextpage-->

[gallery numberposts="6" offset="6"]</code></pre>

<h2>Plugin support</h2>

<p>I run a WordPress community called <a href="http://themehybrid.com" title="Theme Hybrid">Theme Hybrid</a>, which is where I fully support all of my WordPress projects, including plugins.  You can sign up for an account to get plugin support for a small yearly fee ($25 <acronym title="United States Dollars">USD</acronym> at the time of writing).</p>

<p>I know.  I know.  You might not want to pay for support, but just consider it a donation to the project.  To continue making cool, <acronym title="GNU General Public License">GPL</acronym>-licensed plugins and having the time to support them, I must pay the bills.</p>
