A cleaner WordPress [gallery] that integrates with multiple Lightbox-type scripts.

== Description ==

*Cleaner Gallery* was written to take care of the invalid HTML that WordPress produces when using the `[gallery]` shortcode.

It does a bit more than that though.  It will integrate with many Lightbox-type scripts and allow you to do much cooler things with your galleries.  Plus, it has a couple of extra options that you can play around with.

**Features:**

* Validates the aweful HTML that WordPress spits out.
* Several options on how you want your gallery images.
* Allows multiple galleries in a single post.
* Ability to set the number of images shown in each gallery.
* Ability to exclude or include any images from your gallery.
* Doesn't load any CSS or JavaScript unless you choose to do so.

**Integrates with 18 different Lightbox-type scripts:**

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Why was this plugin created? =

The purpose of the Cleaner Gallery plugin is to get rid of the invalid XHTML caused by the default WordPress `[gallery]` shortcode.  But, since I was having so much fun with it, I decided to make it compatible with several Lightbox-type image scripts.

= Why do I have one column of images? =

If you expect multiple columns of images but only have one column, go to *Appearance > Cleaner Gallery* and make sure to select the checkbox for loading the Cleaner Gallery stylesheet.

= Why do my galleries look different after upgrading? =

If you're upgrading the plugin, please update your plugin settings.  You should always check this when upgrading any plugin.  You can do so by going to *Appearance > Cleaner Gallery*.

= Which Lightbox-type scripts will the plugin work with? =

The plugin has been tested and works with these scripts:

= How do I set it up? =

Well, it should work perfectly fine without any set up.  But, if you need to integrate it with a Lightbox-type script or change some of the default settings, head over to *Appearance > Cleaner Gallery* in the WordPress admin.  From there, you can select your preferences.

If you need a more detailed guide, see `readme.html`, which is included with the plugin.
